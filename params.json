Then type:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should build the library in ./lib and all executables in ./bin .\r\nIf cmake gives you trouble concerning the jni include directories, it might help\r\nto specify a correct JAVA_HOME environment variable:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/sdk  cmake #[...], see above\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also try 'make install', but I don't guarantee I haven't forgotten\r\nto specify one or the other binary to be installed. It does install the\r\nlibrary to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib and the more important programs to\r\nCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin . CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX defaults to \"/usr/local/\", but\r\nyou can use 'ccmake' to change the prefix.\r\nJust do\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncmake ..\r\nccmake .  # only if you want to change paths. Just follow the help given in the program.\r\nmake\r\nmake install  # not very well tested\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease report bugs, problems etc. on https://github.com/ulir/FSDict .\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
